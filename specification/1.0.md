# Podcast Specification

## Announcing Podcast Version 1.0 Specification

Podcasts have been around for a long time with no formal, independent specification. This makes writing podcasts hosts, clients, and feeds very difficult, as each producer has their own wants and needs. More importantly, it makes standardizing around _new_ specification almost impossible; creating a stagnating and outdated standard.

This specification outlines what podcasts already are today, cobbled together from the most popular ones available. It functions as a reference point for anyone creating a new host, client, or feed.

## Formats

### XML 1.0

_eXtensible Markup Language_

The file format used for RSS.

### RSS 2.0

_“Rich Site Summary”; originally “RDF Site Summary”; often “Really Simple Syndication”._

RSS is a standardized XML format meant for websites to publish articles without clients needing to periodically load the full content.

### Podcast 1.0

Originally just RSS 2.0 + `<enclosure>` tags. It has since evolved to its own standard, possibly surpassing RSS. Although Podcast 1.0 still conforms to RSS, it is its own dialect of XML.

Why the separation? They have completely different use-cases for the publisher, the user, and the application displaying them. RSS syndicates, aggregates, or links to articles. Podcasts are another medium, delivering audio or video files of long-form, episodic content.

## Tags

\* required by RSS 2.0 (if parent tag is present)  
• required by Podcast 1.0 (if parent tag is present)

```

```

- `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>` is the XML version and encoding declaration. Always `version="1.0"`, almost always `encoding="UTF-8"`.

- `<rss version="2.0">` is the root node and the RSS version declaration. Always `version="2.0"`.

- `<channel>` is the single, required sub-element of `<rss>`.

- `<title>` (string) is the name of the podcast in plain-text.

- `<link>` (URL) is a URL pointing to the homepage of the podcast.

- `<description>` (CDATA) is the long-form description of what the podcast is about.

- `<lastBuildDate>` (RFC 2822) is the date the content of `<channel>` was last changed. Does not apply to any content under an `<item>` tag.

- `<image>` is the square album art for the podcast. It has five sub-elements:

  - `<url>` (URL) is the URL pointing to the image.

  - `<link>` (URL) is a duplicate of `rss.channel.link`.

  - `<title>` (string) is a duplicate of `rss.channel.title`.

  - `<width>` (number, pixels) is the pixel width of the image.

  - `<height>` (number, pixels) is the pixel height of the image.

- `<language>` (ISO 639) is the language the podcast is spoken and written in.

- `<ttl>` (number, minutes) stands for _Time To Live_. It is the number of minutes the podcast should be cached before trying to refresh. For example, if a podcast is once a week, the `<ttl>` will be 10080.

- `<item>` is the parent element of each episode.

- `<guid>` (string) is the unique identifier of each episode and must never change between changes. It is typically the URL of the episode’s `<enclosure>`, but doesn’t have to be.

- `<title>` (string) is the title of the episode in plain-text. It should not include the title of the podcast, just the episode’s title. It may include the episode number.

- `<link>` (URL) is a URL pointing to the webpage representing the episode.

- `<description>` (CDATA) is the long-form description of the episode. It can be plain-text or basic HTML wrapped in CDATA.

- `<pubDate>` (RFC 2822) is the date the episode was released or updated.

- `<enclosure>` is the podcast’s media file, it has three attributes. `url` (URL, MP3/MP4/MOV/M4A/M4V) is the media file’s URL. `length` (number, bytes) is the size of the file. `type` (MIME) is the MIME type of the file.

### iTunes Extension

Although iTunes tags are an Apple-specific extension, many podcast players will still use their information. Tags—such as `<itunes:duration>`—aren’t available in the original RSS.

```
<rss xmlns:itunes="http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd" version="2.0">
  <channel>
    <itunes:author> (String, plain-text)
    <itunes:subtitle> (String, plain-text, short-form)
    <itunes:summary> (String, plain-text, long-form)
    <itunes:explicit> (Bool, yes/no)
    <itunes:image href=url /> (URL)
    <item>
      <itunes:subtitle> (String, plain-text, short-form)
      <itunes:summary> (String, plain-text, long-form)
      <itunes:duration> (h:mm:ss)
      <itunes:explicit> (Bool, yes/no)
```
